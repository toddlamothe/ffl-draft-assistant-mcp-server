## Project-Specific Guidelines

### MCP Server Configuration
This project includes a custom MCP server for fantasy football data with the following components:

**Server Files:**
- `app/server.py` - Main MCP server (use for Cursor IDE)
- `app/server_with_args.py` - MCP server with argument handling (use for MCP Inspector)

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Run the MCP server: `python app/server.py`
3. In Cursor, use the MCP extension to connect to the server
4. Test tools like `get_nfl_injuries()` and `get_player_ratings()`

**MCP Inspector Testing:**
- Launch Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector /Users/todd/code/pigskin-pickem/v5/venv/bin/python -m app.server`
- Use `app/server_with_args.py` to handle Inspector's command-line arguments

### Available MCP Tools (11 total)

**Player Ratings (5 tools):**
- `get_player_ratings()` - Get all player ratings from multiple sources (Madden NFL + PFF)
- `get_player_ratings_by_position(position)` - Filter by position (QB, RB, WR, etc.)
- `get_player_ratings_by_team(team)` - Filter by team name
- `get_player_ratings_by_source(source)` - Get ratings from specific source (Madden NFL, Pro Football Focus)
- `get_player_ratings_stats()` - Get statistics about the combined dataset

**Offensive Line (5 tools):**
- `get_ol_rankings()` - Get all PFF offensive line rankings
- `get_ol_rankings_by_team(team)` - Get OL ranking for specific team
- `get_top_ol_rankings(top_n)` - Get top N offensive line rankings
- `get_ol_rankings_by_rank_range(min_rank, max_rank)` - Get OL rankings within range
- `get_ol_rankings_stats()` - Get statistics about OL rankings dataset

**Injuries (1 tool):**
- `get_nfl_injuries()` - Get latest NFL injuries (cached, refreshed every 24h)

### Data Sources & Caching
- **Madden NFL Ratings**: Scraped from EA's website, cached in `/tmp/pigskin-pickem-cache/`
- **PFF Player Ratings**: Loaded from `data/pff_ratings.csv`, combined with Madden data
- **PFF Offensive Line Rankings**: Scraped from PFF website, cached with 48-hour TTL
- **NFL Injuries**: Scraped from NFL website, cached with 24-hour TTL

## Response Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented Python code
- Use type hints and docstrings for all functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines consistently
- Include error handling and input validation
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Use context managers for resource management
- **Use logging instead of print statements** throughout the project
- **Use pytest for tests** with proper async support

### MCP Implementation Best Practices
- Design tools with clear, single responsibilities
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Validate all inputs and outputs according to MCP schemas
- Handle connection lifecycle events appropriately
- Implement timeouts and retry logic for external operations
- **Log cache hits/misses** for all data requests

### Fantasy Football Analysis Guidelines
- Focus on **PPR league** analysis (12 rounds)
- Consider **position-specific factors**:
  - **RBs**: Offensive line ratings, run-blocking grades
  - **WRs**: QB ratings, passing efficiency, offensive scheme
  - **QBs**: Offensive line protection, receiving corps quality
- Analyze **offensive schemes**: Pass-friendly vs run-heavy
- Check for **key injuries** to QB or offensive line
- Provide **draft recommendations** with round suggestions
- Use **MCP tools first**, then web research for additional context

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify the specific use case and constraints
2. **Design Architecture**: Plan the overall structure and component interactions
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Start with core functionality, add features iteratively
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
5. **Document Clearly**: Provide usage examples and API documentation
6. **Optimize Performance**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks as needed

### Code Examples
- Provide complete, runnable examples when possible
- Include both basic and advanced usage patterns
- Show proper error handling and edge case management
- Demonstrate testing strategies and mock usage
- Include relevant imports and setup code

## Communication Style
- Be precise and technical while remaining accessible
- Provide context for design decisions and trade-offs
- Suggest alternatives when multiple approaches are viable
- Reference official documentation and best practices
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

## Areas of Focus
- Modern Python features (3.8+) including walrus operator, positional-only parameters
- Async/await patterns and concurrent programming
- MCP server development and tool creation
- Integration with popular IDEs and development environments
- Performance optimization and profiling techniques
- Security considerations in MCP implementations
- Cross-platform compatibility and deployment strategies
- **Fantasy Football data analysis and player evaluation**
- **Web scraping and data integration from multiple sources**
- **Caching strategies for external data sources**
